  <h1 class="alert-heading">Legacy</h1><hr>
  <p class="text-italic">The YMCA University of Science and Technology, Faridabad erstwhile YMCA Institute of Engineering, Faridabad was established in the year 1969, as a joint venture of the National Council of YMCAs of India, Govt of Haryana, and the Central Agencies for Development Aid, Bonn, Germany. It started as an Indo-German project with an aim to impart technical education to a developing India on German pattern.<br>
The labs & workshops have been setup with the assistance of German expertise. In 1996, State Govt. of Haryana took complete control of the Institute and upgraded it to University status in Dec. 2009. The university offers 4-year B.Tech degree course in seven disciplines i.e
<ul>
<li>Civil Engineering</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Information Technology</li>
<li>Electronics & Instrumentation Control</li>
<li>Electronics & Communication Engineering</li>
<li>Electrical Engineering</li>
<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
</ul>
The university has added new chapters in it’s glorious history i.e M.B.A., M.C.A, M.Tech. (Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering & Mechanical Engineering), M.Sc. (Physics, Maths, Chemistry & Environmental Sciences), M.A.(Mass Communication and Journalism) and Ph.D.<br>
It follows it’s course curriculum duly approved by the industries and the University. The salient features of German education have been retained & as such the University stands apart from other colleges of Haryana.<br>
Right from the very beginning at institutional level, it has emphasized greatly on practical work related to industry. As a result our students are well accepted by the industries. The fact that many of them are entrepreneur with names of repute at national and international level establishes the same.<br>
The University is situated on National Highway-2, Mathura Road, 30 km from National Capital, Delhi. The University campus is located in the sprawling Faridabad-Ballabgarh Industrial complex.<br>
The sophisticated equipments/machines in the workshops and laboratories enable the students to operate various machines independently so as to acquire thorough knowledge and develop competence in their respective skills.</p>

<p class="text-monospace">YMCA University of Science and Technology has been in existence for the past 48 years and consistently been contributing towards creation of competent engineering professionals and entrepreneurs. An Institution that had a humble beginning as a post diploma institution and famous for generating skilled technical human resource for the industry has been elevated in 2009 as University of Science and Technology to further create competent human resource in diversified areas of Science & Technology. The competence of the University has been recognized at various levels by the agencies like UGC (grant of 12B status), accreditation (NAAC Grade ‘A’), NIRF (best ranking amongst State Engineering Universities in Haryana), etc.<br>
Moving ahead on the path of excellence, the University is ready to effectively take up the forthcoming challenges in diversified domains. To accomplish this, new courses are being added and new facilities are being developed on continuous basis. Inculcation of ethical and moral values among youth is one of our prime concerns. To achieve this goal, the Vivekanand Manch has been conducting various events.<br>
<strong>Prof. Dinesh Kumar</strong><br>
Apart from creating highly qualified professionals, we are involved in imparting basic technological skills for underprivileged section of the society through its Community College programs. The University boasts of its strong industry interaction that is evident from excellent placement of students and also from the existence of industry linked labs and collaborations. Alumni are our brand ambassadors and many of them are entrepreneurs and occupying key positions in various Govt./Private organizations. We at YMCA University are committed to the Nation’s development by taking up more scientific and technological projects meant for the direct upliftment of the society.<br>
Keeping in view its excellent performance, the Government of Haryana has mandated the University to affiliate other Engineering Institutions situated in the District of Faridabad and Palwal. I am sure that this association will be highly beneficial to the various stakeholders in upgrading and monitoring the quality of technical education.<br>
We are working to make the University environment efficient and tech-savvy and for this we are participating in programs like Digital India, Skill India, Make in India, Clean India, etc. by its various stake holders. We are committed to meet the expectations of all its stake holders and want to realize its vision to emerge as a centre of excellence in various fields both at national and international levels for which I solicit the participation of one and all.<br>
